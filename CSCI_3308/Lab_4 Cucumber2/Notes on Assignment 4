Notes on Assignment 4

- Always run bundle commands as "bundle exec <commandName>"
- To create tags to see the changes in commits use the follow commands:
	- git tag <tag name> 
	- git diff <tag name>    // This will show the differences this commit
	- git push origin -tags  // pushes tags to remote repo

- The line of code:
		
		Given /^(?:|I ) am on (.+)$/ 

  is a regular expression that captures everything after "am on" until the end of line (EoL)

- Becareful with whitespaces in cucumber feature files. Some problems may arise from parser errors from the regexes due to these extra whitespaces.

- The Rails flunk method unsures an error and spits out a message. Useful at the start of your cucumber. flunk <msg>

- The =~ operator is used to match regular expressions against strings

- The Cucumber <steps> method matches any steps to any step definition using regular expressions
